# Implementation Plan: Book Borrowing System

**Branch**: `001-a-book-borrow` | **Date**: 2025-10-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-a-book-borrow/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a book borrowing system interface as a static single-page application hosted on GitHub Pages. Users can browse available books, borrow books by providing their name/ID, view borrowed books with borrower information, and return books. The system uses Vue.js (no framework) with 4 backend APIs for data operations. Primary focus: simple, responsive interface with instant UI updates after transactions.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES6+ (modern browser support)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vue 3.x (CDN - no build tools), vanilla CSS for styling  
**Storage**: N/A (frontend only - backend APIs handle persistence)  
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (testing approach for Vue without build tools)  
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions), GitHub Pages static hosting

**Project Type**: Web application (frontend only - single-page app)  
**Performance Goals**: Page load <2s, API response rendering <1s, support responsive design 320px-2560px viewport  
**Constraints**: No build tools or bundlers (Vue via CDN), must work as static files on GitHub Pages, CORS-compatible API calls  
**Scale/Scope**: Small-scale library system, 2 pages (available/borrowed books), 4 API integrations, <5 components

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: ⚠️  Constitution file contains only template placeholders - no project-specific principles defined yet.

**Assessment**: Since this is a new project without an established constitution, proceeding with standard web application best practices:
- Component-based architecture
- Separation of concerns (API layer, UI components, state management)
- Error handling and user feedback
- Responsive design principles

**Re-evaluation Required**: After Phase 1 design artifacts are complete, review against any established project constitution or create initial constitution based on this feature's patterns.

```

**Structure Decision**: Simple flat structure suitable for GitHub Pages static hosting. No build process means direct browser-executable files. Vue components defined as plain JavaScript modules. Separation by concern (API layer, components, page logic) while maintaining simplicity for CDN-based Vue usage.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

N/A - No constitution violations as project constitution is not yet defined. This feature will establish baseline patterns.
