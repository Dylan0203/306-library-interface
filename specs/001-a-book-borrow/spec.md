# Feature Specification: Book Borrowing System

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-book-borrow`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "a book borrow system interface use github page, use vue no frame work, only 3 api"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse Available Books (Priority: P1)

A library patron visits the system to see what books are currently available for borrowing. They can view book titles and authors in the available books list to decide which book they want to borrow.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability - users cannot borrow books if they cannot see what's available. This delivers immediate value by making the library catalog accessible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the interface and viewing the available books list. Delivers value even without borrowing capability by providing catalog visibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user opens the application, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a list of available books with title and author
2. **Given** the available books list is displayed, **When** books are available for borrowing, **Then** they appear in this list with visual indication they can be borrowed
3. **Given** the book list is empty, **When** no books are available, **Then** the user sees a message "No books currently available"
4. **Given** the book list fails to load, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the user sees a clear error message explaining the issue

### User Story 2 - Borrow a Book (Priority: P2)

A library patron finds a book they want and borrows it directly through the interface. They enter their name or ID, click on an available book, and confirm the borrowing action, immediately seeing the status update.

**Why this priority**: This is the core transactional feature that fulfills the system's primary purpose. Depends on book browsing (P1) but is independently testable once book data is available.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by entering a borrower name/ID, selecting any available book, and verifying the borrow action succeeds, updates the book status, and prevents duplicate borrows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a book is available, **When** the user enters their name/ID and clicks to borrow it, **Then** the book status changes to "Borrowed" and shows the borrower's name
2. **Given** a user attempts to borrow without entering name/ID, **When** they click borrow, **Then** the system prompts them to provide their name/ID
3. **Given** a book is already borrowed, **When** the user attempts to borrow it, **Then** the system prevents the action and shows "Already Borrowed by [borrower name]" message
4. **Given** the user borrows a book, **When** the borrow action completes, **Then** the change is reflected immediately without page reload
5. **Given** the borrow request fails, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the user sees a clear error message and the book status remains unchanged

### User Story 3 - Return a Borrowed Book (Priority: P3)

Any user views the borrowed books list and returns a previously borrowed book, making it available for others. They can see who borrowed each book, select a borrowed book, and confirm the return action without needing to verify their identity.

**Why this priority**: Completes the borrowing lifecycle and enables book circulation. While important, the system delivers value without it in the short term (users can still browse and borrow available books).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by any user viewing the borrowed books list, selecting a borrowed book, initiating return, and verifying the book becomes available again (appears in available list, disappears from borrowed list).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user views the borrowed books list, **When** the list loads, **Then** they see all currently borrowed books with title, author, and borrower name/ID
2. **Given** a book is currently borrowed, **When** any user initiates a return, **Then** the book disappears from borrowed list and appears in available list with borrower name cleared
3. **Given** the borrowed books list is empty, **When** no books are borrowed, **Then** the user sees a message "No books currently borrowed"
4. **Given** a user returns a book, **When** the return action completes, **Then** both lists update immediately without page reload
5. **Given** the return request fails, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the user sees a clear error message and the book remains in borrowed list

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple users try to borrow the same available book simultaneously?
- How does the system handle network failures during borrow/return operations?
- What happens when both book lists are empty (no books in the system)?
- What happens when only the available list is empty (all books borrowed)?
- What happens when only the borrowed list is empty (all books available)?
- How does the system respond when an API returns invalid or malformed data?
- What happens if a user refreshes the page during a borrow/return operation?
- How does the system handle extremely long book titles, author names, or borrower names in the display?
- What happens if the borrowed books API loads but the available books API fails (or vice versa)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide two separate pages: one for available books and one for borrowed books
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide navigation allowing users to switch between available and borrowed book pages
- **FR-003**: System MUST retrieve available books data from dedicated API endpoint showing title and author
- **FR-004**: System MUST retrieve borrowed books data from dedicated API endpoint showing title, author, and borrower name/ID
- **FR-005**: System MUST show empty state messages when available or borrowed lists are empty
- **FR-006**: System MUST require users to provide their name or ID before borrowing a book
- **FR-007**: System MUST accept free text input for borrower name or ID with no validation constraints
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to borrow any book from the available books page after providing their name/ID
- **FR-009**: System MUST update the available books page after successful borrow to reflect the book is no longer available
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent users from borrowing a book that is not in the available list
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow any user to return any book from the borrowed books page without identity verification
- **FR-012**: System MUST update the borrowed books page after successful return to reflect the book is no longer borrowed
- **FR-013**: System MUST update the current page immediately after successful borrow or return operations without requiring page reload
- **FR-014**: System MUST display clear error messages when operations fail
- **FR-015**: System MUST prevent duplicate borrow requests for the same book
- **FR-016**: System MUST be publicly accessible via web browser
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide instant interactivity without requiring page reloads for core operations

### Key Entities

- **Book**: Represents a physical or digital book in the library catalog. Key attributes include unique identifier, title, author name, current availability status (available or borrowed), and borrower name/ID (when borrowed).

- **Borrow Transaction**: Represents the action of borrowing a book. Captures which book was borrowed, the borrower's name/ID, and when the status changed.

- **Return Transaction**: Represents the action of returning a book. Captures which book was returned and when it became available again.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: How does the system identify the borrower? → A: User enters their name/ID each time they borrow (free text input)
- Q: Who is allowed to return a borrowed book? → A: Anyone can return any borrowed book (no verification)
- Q: Which books should the list display? → A: The backend API filters and returns only available books
- Q: How do users see borrowed books to return them? → A: There will be a separate API for borrowed books list (4 APIs total: get available, get borrowed, post borrow, post return)
- Q: How should the two lists be presented to users? → A: Separate pages - user navigates between available and borrowed views

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view the complete book catalog within 2 seconds of page load
- **SC-002**: Users can complete a book borrowing action in under 5 seconds from selection to confirmation
- **SC-003**: Book status updates are reflected in the interface within 1 second of successful operation
- **SC-004**: 95% of users successfully complete their intended borrow or return action on first attempt
- **SC-005**: System displays appropriate error messages for 100% of failed operations
- **SC-006**: Interface remains responsive and usable on devices with viewport widths from 320px to 2560px
- **SC-007**: System prevents 100% of invalid operations (borrowing borrowed books, returning available books)
- **SC-008**: Users can understand book availability status within 3 seconds of viewing the list (measured by task completion in usability testing)

## Assumptions

1. **API Availability**: The four API endpoints are already implemented and available for use
2. **API Endpoints**: The four APIs are: (1) GET available books list, (2) GET borrowed books list, (3) POST borrow book, (4) POST return book
3. **Authentication**: No user authentication or authorization is required - any visitor can borrow/return any book
4. **Data Persistence**: Book status is persisted on the server side via API calls
5. **Concurrent Users**: API handles concurrent access and prevents race conditions server-side
6. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES6+ JavaScript support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions)
7. **Network**: Users have reliable internet connection for API calls
8. **Book Uniqueness**: Each book has a unique identifier provided by the API
9. **Static Hosting**: GitHub Pages can serve the single-page application without configuration beyond standard static hosting

## Dependencies

- GitHub Pages hosting service availability
- Four backend API endpoints (URLs to be provided)
- All APIs must return JSON responses in consistent format
- All APIs must handle CORS for GitHub Pages domain
- Available books API must filter and return only non-borrowed books
- Borrowed books API must filter and return only currently borrowed books with borrower information

## Out of Scope

- Book reservation system or waitlists
- Due dates or late fees tracking
- Book search or filtering capabilities
- Book recommendations or rating system
- Borrowing history or user profiles
- Multi-library support
