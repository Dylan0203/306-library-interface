## Validation History

### Iteration 1 (2025-10-10)
**Issues Found:**
- FR-002: Mentioned "three API endpoints" (implementation constraint)
- FR-011: Mentioned "GitHub Pages" (implementation detail)
- FR-012: Mentioned "browser without server-side processing" (implementation detail)

**Resolution:**
- FR-002: Changed to "retrieve book data from remote data source"

- FR-012: Changed to "provide instant interactivity without requiring page reloads"

**Result:** All items now pass âœ…

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`
- Implementation constraints (Vue, GitHub Pages, 3 APIs) documented in Assumptions section where appropriate
